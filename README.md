# candleLight

A candleLight is a flash drive sized USB CAN dongle.
It works with the
[candle-usb candleLight firmware](https://github.com/candle-usb/candleLight_fw).

This is a fork of [HubertD's candleLight](https://github.com/HubertD/candleLight)
KiCAD project. Thanks for sharing this awesome design as open hardware!
